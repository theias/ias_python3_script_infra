# These are (PHP centric) targets used for automating specific
# types of tests.
#
# In general, the test targets should assume that the enviroment
# for testing has already been set up.
#
# Targets for setting up the test environment can be defined
# and can, for example, be called in your CI/CD scripts which
# then would keep those environments cached for testing.
