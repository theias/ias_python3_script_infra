## Description

* some_script.sh - does something.

# Supplemental Documentation

Supplemental documentation for this project can be found here:

* [Supplemental Documentation](./doc/index.md)

# Installation

Ideally stuff should run if you clone the git repo, and install the deps specified
in either "deb_control" or "rpm_specific"

Optionally, you can build a package which will install the binaries in

* /opt/IAS/bin/ias-python3-script-infra/.

# Building a Package

## Requirements

### All Systems

* fakeroot

### Debian

* build-essential

### RHEL based systems

* rpm-build

## Export a specific tag (or just the source directory)

## Supported Systems

### Debian packages

<pre>
  fakeroot make clean install debsetup debbuild
</pre>

### RHEL Based Systems

If you're building from a tag, and the spec file has been put
into the tag, then you can build this on any system that has
rpm building utilities installed, without fakeroot:

<pre>
make clean install cp-rpmspec rpmbuild
</pre>

This will generate a new spec file every time:

<pre>
fakeroot make clean install rpmspec rpmbuild
</pre>
